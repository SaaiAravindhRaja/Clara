# 🎯 How to Run Your AI Calendar System

## 📍 **WHERE THE OUTPUT APPEARS:**

### **Option 1: Local Terminal (Recommended for testing)**
- Output appears in **your local terminal/command prompt**
- This is where you'll see the Layer 1 analysis and Layer 2 instructions

### **Option 2: Orgo Cloud (For actual calendar creation)**
- The Agent-S execution happens on **https://www.orgo.ai/projects/computer-ppgg5d6j**
- You'll see the actual browser automation and calendar creation there

## 🚀 **STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

### **Step 1: Run the System**
```bash
python run_calendar_system.py
```

### **Step 2: Choose Your Interface**
You'll see a menu:
```
1. 🖥️  Terminal Interface (text-based)
2. 🖼️  GUI Interface (graphical)  
3. 🧪 Test System
4. ❌ Exit
```

### **Step 3: Test First (Recommended)**
- Choose option **3** to test the system
- This will show you how Layer 1 analyzes your input
- No actual calendar creation, just testing the prompt engineering

### **Step 4: Use the System**
- Choose option **1** for terminal interface
- Choose option **2** for GUI interface
- Type something like: "Create a diving event on August 22nd at 8am"

## 🔄 **What Happens:**

### **Layer 1 (Prompt Engineering) - Runs Locally:**
1. Analyzes your input
2. Identifies missing details
3. Asks clarification questions
4. Generates optimized Agent-S instruction
5. **Output appears in your terminal**

### **Layer 2 (Agent-S) - Runs on Orgo:**
1. Takes the optimized instruction
2. Opens Firefox on Orgo cloud
3. Navigates to Google Calendar
4. Creates the actual event
5. **Output appears on https://www.orgo.ai/projects/computer-ppgg5d6j**

## 🎯 **Example Flow:**

**You type:** "diving event August 22nd 8am"

**Layer 1 output (in terminal):**
```
🎯 Processing request: diving event August 22nd 8am
📊 Confidence level: 75%
❓ Missing information: duration
How long will the diving event last? 2 hours
🤖 Agent-S Instruction: Open Firefox, navigate to Google Calendar...
```

**Layer 2 output (on Orgo):**
- Browser opens
- Navigates to calendar.google.com
- Creates the event
- Shows success/failure

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If API key error:**
- Check that `.env` file exists with your API key
- Run the launcher script: `python run_calendar_system.py`

### **If import errors:**
- Make sure all files are in the same directory
- Install dependencies: `pip install python-dotenv openai`

### **If Agent-S doesn't work:**
- Check your Orgo project is running
- Verify Agent-S is properly configured
- Test with simple Agent-S commands first
